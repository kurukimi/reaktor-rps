# Reaktor pre-assignment
my solution for the Reaktor pre-assignment 2022 for Summer Developers. This repository has the react frontend and node express backend for the app. 
There's also my heroku build at: https://github.com/kurukimi/rps-heroku

And live build at: https://reaktor-rps2022.herokuapp.com/

## Running locally

Set env file DB variable equal to mongodb://mongodb:27017/my_database, or some other mongodb database.
run command: docker-compose up

after setup app runs at `localhost:80`
